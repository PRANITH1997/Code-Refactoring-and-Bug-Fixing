Code Refactoring and Bug Fixing
Python:

Refactoring:

Identify duplicated code and extract it into functions or classes to improve code reuse.
Simplify complex expressions or nested conditions to make the code more readable.
Rename variables, functions, or classes to make their purpose clearer.
Bug fixing:

Identify the root cause of the bug by analyzing error messages, logs, and the code itself.
Use debugging tools like pdb or print statements to trace the code and understand its flow.
Fix the bug by modifying the code logic or correcting errors such as typos, incorrect variable assignments, or incorrect function calls.
HTML:

Refactoring:

Ensure proper indentation and formatting for better readability.
Use semantic HTML tags to improve the structure and meaning of the content.
Remove inline styles and use CSS classes for styling to separate content from presentation.
Bug fixing:

Check for missing or mismatched HTML tags, which can cause layout issues or rendering errors.
Validate HTML using tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service to identify and fix syntax errors.
Use browser developer tools to inspect and debug HTML elements and styles.
